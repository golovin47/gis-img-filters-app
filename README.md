A very simple app to apply various filters to images. It uses https://github.com/emonm/AndroidPhotoFilters as low level filter implementation, and https://github.com/ArkadyGamza/Camera2API_rxJava2 as the code base for camera module. 
Camera module implemented using Kotlin, Camera2 API, MVI approach, RxJava2 and Fragment as a view controller. You can simply copy/paste Camera module from this app to your Android project and customize it the way you want.
